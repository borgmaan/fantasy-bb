## Draft App Ideas

### UI

- Remove players from UI as they are drafted.
- Ranked lists: overall, by position, batters & pitchers
- Compare projected stat totals for team to stat totals from past years
- Integrate ADP to estimate player availabilty later in draft
- Also use ADP to attempt to decide which players to draft when
