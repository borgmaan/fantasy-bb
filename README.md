## Fantasy Baseball Fun

Project to scrape a bunch of projections to get consensus player ratings for upcoming draft. Also includes `shiny` app to visualize and navigate ratings during draft. Hopefully more in-season work to come. App can be run from top repository's top directory with [whatever method you choose](https://github.com/yihui/configuration/blob/master/shiny).
